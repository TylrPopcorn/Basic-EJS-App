# `Basic-EJS-App`

`A simple app that shows how to use EJS (Embedded JavaScript)`

This application showcases how to integrate EJS with Express to render dynamic content. By utilizing data from data.json, the app demonstrates passing variables to EJS templates, enabling the creation of web pages that adapt based on the provided data.

For those new to EJS and Express, this repository offers a practical example of:
- Setting up an Express server with EJS as the view engine.
- Organizing project directories for server files, templates, and static assets.
- Passing data to templates to render dynamic content.

Exploring this repository can provide valuable insights into building server-rendered applications using Node.js and EJS.
